# 4402 Project Documentation:

## Pre Req:

- SQLite3
- GCC/Clang
- Make

I spent too much time trying to get docker working properly to just have a docker file set up oops.

Install dependincies and then clone github.

-make clean
then -make clean to run code. If database can't open you may have to change the dbString at the top of main.c

Happy grading!
